# Pig Game üé≤üê∑

Pig Game is a simple, interactive dice game built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The objective is for players to take turns rolling a dice and accumulating points, aiming to reach a predetermined score without rolling a "1", which resets their turn score. This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts such as event handling, DOM manipulation and state management.

2. **Roll Dice**:
   - If a player rolls any number other than 1, it is added to their **current score**.
   - If they roll a 1, their turn ends and their **current score** resets to 0.
3. **Hold**:
   - A player can choose to "hold," adding their **current score** to their **total score**.
   - This ends their turn, passing control to the other player.
